	   An exhibition with Tim Choin in the basements of the Zebrastraat. 
	   An audio tour guide was played through a speaker held by a performer. 
	   A fifteen guided minute walk in the basement paused at every work and included every work in a demonstration of inventions.
	   Listen to the audio guide.
