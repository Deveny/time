 				Film collaboration with AnnaMarie Ignarro, within the concept of 40' of <a href="https://www.offoff.be" target="_blank">Art Cinema OFFOff</a>. 
 				AnnaMarie worked on the soundtrack of a 40-minute video essay and performed live during the screening. 
 				The space was split with a diagonal curtain that started at the entrance, obliging the visitors to choose to see either the concert of the soundtrack or the projected film.   
 				</mark></p><p><mark>Analog to the logic of DEVE FALLS, an earlier project, every location filmed is outside of my hometown. 
 				The work is not to be mistaken with the found footage from own archive methodology of <span onmouseover="openLink('devefalls',this)">the series 
 				(DEVE FALLS: All The Time In The World 100). </span>
