The last and the first time I had a conversation with the Pacific, I stood in it. 
The Pacific sometimes reaches out to one's feet when they meet the edges of its formation. 
It calls out to the Land and to the beings inhabiting the Land, searching for proximity. 
One can take a plunge and then make the acquaintance of the biggest ocean. 
During our brief conversation the Pacific told me it was an inventor. 
Its first majestic invention was a shape without a name. 
It was a collection of all the substances that weren't submerged by the water.
The Ocean itself moulded these into a shape. 
	Pangea, I asked.
	My first sculpture, it replied.
Yet it believed not to be a sculptor but simply a maker. 
Its endless blue appearance defines all other mass than itself. 
The Pacific explained:
“With every subtle movement I make I rearrange the shapes I have made before. My own form has no limits. I leave an endless space for my creations to grow.”

Looking over the Pacific I had an infinite view on its aquamarine surface. 
When diving and glancing into the expanse underneath the surface, my view was sight was suddenly limited in distance.  The Ocean meets the sky. None of them are blue, they only seem so.
